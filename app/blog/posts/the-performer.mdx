## Act 1: The performance

The performer gets up to the stage. Today's public is filled with familiar faces as usual. The performer knows what the public expects, making it easier to move through the stage with the mask on. The act is not particularly enjoyable to the performer, but at least their feet aren't hurting and the public seems to mildly enjoy it. 

That is until *his* mother enters through the door. The perfomer cannot fail, since the anger will leave long lasting pain. She seems appeased, but judgy, as if waiting, expecting, yearning for something to go wrong. 

The perfomer dances, strikes poses, changes masks, even fakes accents as to weave the story. People leave and enter the room, no one wants to see the piece forever, and they can always return the next day. The performer will always be there for them to enjoy.

The perfomer is too entranced, too concentrated, to look at the public properly, whoever enters is allowed to enjoy and to ask. Unable to see them, someone enters the room, and as they are moving through the stage, a bollet pierces the performer's leg. 

## Act 2: The shot

Pain engulfs the performer's leg. But his mother is still in the public. Failure will not be tolerated, **the show cannot end**.

Blood puddles on the stage, slowly draining the performer. Movement becomes harder, the performance is loosing its audience. Most of them are here because of how stable and perfect the dances, so the sloppiness is not expected regardless of the blood. 

And it happens, a quick spin is faltered by the accumulated blood and the performer falls, prompting his mothers wrath. The performer tries to get up and continue, but to no avail. The gestures keep getting corrected, the neverending pain si mixed the loss of boold, only finishin once the performance is finished, and his mother leaves the stage.

## Act 3: Cleaning

The performer still has to clean. For the sake of tomorrows's performance, all blood must be moped, all clothes cleaed, the bullet plucked out and the new would covered. 

There is no time to do it properly, so this will leave another scar. Lucky for the perfomer, the clothes are long and thick so everything will be hidden under, regardless of how big and ugly those scars get.

The performer goes throughly, leaving everything as it was early in the morning. And only when they finish, the performer takes off the mask.

## Act 4: Freedom

She just wants to cry. Tears fall off her face. Every day, every act, the pain is becoming unbearable. The resent to the public, whose only desire is to enjoy, the sadness of expecting more yet knowing they will leave. The performance is the only thing she knows, the performance is the sword that pierces the soul and the wall that hides the marks. 

She dances on stage before closing the curtains. There is no one to see, so it is easier to move, to express. Her steps grow in confidence, the movements flow without the need of reharsal. She smiles.

But tomorrow gets close and close. She has to be able to keep the act, so she has to stop. She cannot allow herself to enjoy this **too much**.

Swallows the pain, closes her eyes, and sleeps without dreaming.
