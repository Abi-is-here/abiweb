Change your lenses, rewrite your past, reconstruct your realitym, bend the light until the landscape shines as you want it to do.

Reality, what it actually *IS* is impossible to know, since the only way to perceive it is thorugh the body, through the mind, inherenly expanding the meaning by adding the memories, the assumptions, the symbology learnt and turned into dogma. A simple action as responding a message can grow out of the simple words used, retelling its own story, becoming something else. In such a paradigm the inner context of the reader shapes one's perception as much or even more than the actual, real, action.

Even worse, as these changes apply to one's memories, constantly rewriting, reconstructing, recontextualizing them. Memories become self-perception traps, justifications to the insecurities, deleting all semblance to the reality. A light conversation with a friend becomes the reason you can't see them anymore, an angty comment from your loved ones becomes a confirmation of the monster you are. 

This constant recontextualization of the past, present and future keeps you trapped, constantly self loathing, closed off. The worse your lenses are, the easier it is to have your inner world collapsing.

The good part? One can change the lenses. Reshape the perception, choose how reality happens. Bend reality at your will, choose to believe what you want the world to be.

Don't focus on bruteforcing it, use simple truths and keep at check the old ones, let time do the rest. The world can be a cruel, devoid, often unforgivable place, or an everending stream of joy and discovery. It is not a matter of which it is, or if it is both at the same time, it is how are you willing to perceive it, what details matter yo you, where you draw the line, which experiences are worth your memory, your energy. 

Call it delusion, blind optimism, call it a simplification of life, but the choice between constantly allowing yourself be miserable by your situation or those around you will never change them, and given the option to concentrate on good, I think is fairly obvious which one will add value to your life.
